The Trajectory Prediction and Filtering project is a comprehensive solution for predicting and refining trajectories using advanced machine learning techniques and Kalman filtering. It utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Fourier Features (RFF) to predict trajectory positions based on RSSI data from wireless sensor networks. The project includes custom implementations of Kalman filters to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce errors. The provided code performs predictions, applies filtering, and visualizes the results using Matplotlib, demonstrating a robust approach to trajectory estimation and analysis. To use the project, ensure that the necessary data files are in place, and run the script to see error metrics and visualizations of predicted and filtered trajectories.
